This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}


#TODO: Make this a relatie reference so we can bundle the file in a github repo
PMA92C10 <- read.csv("C:\\Users\\David\\Dropbox\\Code\\Data\\stripped pma92c10.xls - PMA92C10.csv")

work_df <- PMA92C10

x <- 40

qxs <- work_df[work_df$age >= x,]$qx
ages <- work_df[work_df$age >= x,]$age
tpxs <- Reduce("*",1-qxs,1,accumulate=TRUE)
#Reduce produces one more entry than you started with,
#ie v length n, returns v length n+1. So level up ages.
ages <- c(ages, max(ages)+1)

exs_stoch_fn <- function(age, tpxs) {

  rf <- runif(1, min=0, max=1)
  approx(tpxs, age, rf)$y
  
  }


exs_stoch_fn(ages, tpxs)

c(exs_stoch_fn(ages, tpxs),exs_stoch_fn(ages, tpxs))


ex_sample <- 

```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
a_n_cts <- function(i,t) {(1-(1+i)^-t)/(ln(1+i))}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
